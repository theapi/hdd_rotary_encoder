# Arduino Hard Drive Rotary Encoder
Use a hard drive motor as a rotary encoder.

One of the motor connectors is common and tied to ground. 
Use the one that measures least resistors to the others.
Then connect two of the other connections to A0 & A1.

A Processing sketch is included which draws the motion into a window.

This is based on http://www.circuitsathome.com/mcu/reading-rotary-encoder-on-arduino
It is fast and efficient due to using the lookup table to determine direction and validity.
```
   The lookup table of the binary values represented by enc_states 
     ___     ___     __
   A    |   |   |   |
        |___|   |___|
      1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1
      1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1
     _____     ___     __
   B      |   |   |   |
          |___|   |___|
   
   A is represented by bit 0 and bit 2
   B is represented by bit 1 and bit 3
   With previous and current values stored in 4 bit data there can be
   16 possible combinations.
   The enc_states lookup table represents each one and what it means:
   
   [0] = 0000; A & B both low as before: no change : 0
   [1] = 0001; A just became high while B is low: reverse : -1
   [2] = 0010; B just became high while A is low: forward : +1
   [3] = 0011; B & A are both high after both low: invalid : 0
   [4] = 0100; A just became low while B is low: forward : +1
   [5] = 0101; A just became high after already being high: invalid : 0
   [6] = 0110; B just became high while A became low: invalid : 0
   [7] = 0111; A just became high while B was already high: reverse : -1
   [8] = 1000; B just became low while A was already low: reverse : -1
   etc...
   
   Forward: 1101 (13) - 0100 (4) - 0010 (2) - 1011 (11)
   Reverse: 1110 (14) - 1000 (8) - 0001 (1) - 0111 (7)
